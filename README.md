# Movie-Recommender-System
Most platforms we used nowadays, for example, Youtube, Amazon, Netflix, are supported by recommender systems. And it helps personalize the recommendations based on users' interest and browsing history, purchasing history. Netflix even has provided a Netflix Prize to honour teams that can make improvements on predicting users' ratings for movies. 
And in this report, we used MovieLens data sets colleted by the GroupLens Research Project. And it contains 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1682 movies.
And we have proposed the implemented these models:

1. PMF
2. Add temporal features to the PMF
3. Use side info in addition to latents
4. Non-linear matrix factorization
